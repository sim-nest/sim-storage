//! Filesystem-backed table store for SIM.
//!
//! This crate exposes a host directory as a SIM table: each table key maps to a
//! file, and nested tables map to subdirectories. Reads are gated by `fs/read`;
//! writes, deletes, and directory mutation are gated by `fs/write`.
//! Compatibility `table.fs.*` aliases are accepted by the gates. Values are encoded through
//! the configured codec. With the optional format features enabled, recognized
//! extensions (for example `.mid`, `.music`, `.tone`, `.scl`, `.ly`) round-trip
//! through their domain shapes.
